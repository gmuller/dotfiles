It uses temporary files to feed them into ghc-mod (since it does\nnot read from stdin)\n\nIf ghc-mod/ghc-modi is not in your PATH, set full path to those in config.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nYou need to have `ghc-mod`, `ghc-modi` (part of Ghc-Mod) and `hlint` executables\ninstalled on your system. `ghc-mod` needs to be able to find `hlint` (eiter add `hlint` directory to PATH, or install both in the same cabal sandbox).\n\nSupported `ghc-mod` versions are from 4.1.0 to 5.2.1.2.\n\nQuick setup is as follows:\n\n```\n$ cabal update\n$ cabal install ghc-mod hlint\n```\n\nAfter this process finishes, you'll have `ghc-mod`, `ghc-modi` and `hlint` available in `$HOME/.cabal/bin/` directory.\n\nPlease note, that there are some problems with `ghc-mod` and `cabal>=1.22`.\nConsult [ghc-mod wiki page][inconsistent-cabal] for more information.\n\nUser interface is provided by [ide-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell)\n\n[inconsistent-cabal]: https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/ghc-mod/wiki/InconsistentCabalVersions\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ apm install language-haskell haskell-ghc-mod ide-haskell autocomplete-haskell\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nOnly configuration options you will likely need to set are `ghcModPath` and\n`ghcModiPath`. Both need to be set to full path to `ghc-mod` and `ghc-modi`\nprograms respectively, if those are not in your PATH.\n\nThere can be some problems with ghc-modi upstream, most notably, it does not\nwork on paths with whitespace. If you experience problems, try disabling\n`ghc-modi` by setting `enableGhcModi` to `false` (or uncheck tick in settings).\nThis will be slower, but may work better on some configurations.\n\nIf you are on OSX, or have ghc installed with non-standard prefix, you may also\nconsider adding path to directory containing ghc/ghci executable to\n`additionalPathDirectories` configuration option. It is a comma-separated list\nof directories that will be added to your search path when invoking ghc-mod.\nFor example, if you have ghc installed to `/usr/local`, then you would add\n`/usr/local/bin` to `additionalPathDirectories`.\n\nOn OSX, if you start Atom from Finder or with desktop icon, it doesn't inherit\nenvironment variables specified in your user shell (in `.profile`, `.bashrc`,\netc). You can copy `PATH` settings from your shell to\n`additionalPathDirectories`, if you'd like to run Atom in this way.\n\n## Service-hub API\n\nSince 0.6.0, haskell-ghc-mod provides two services, namely `haskell-ide-backend`\nand `haskell-completion-backend`.\n\nYou can find description of these services in relevant source files:\n\n* [ide-backend.coffee][1]\n* [completion-backend.coffee][2]\n\n[1]:https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/blob/master/lib/ide-backend.coffee\n[2]:https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/blob/master/lib/completion-backend.coffee\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod","_id":"haskell-ghc-mod@0.8.3","_shasum":"bd70af6e06e517a0589da064023ee58cac7ab526","_resolved":"file:../d-115615-23378-1n1aj6g/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115615-23378-1n1aj6g/package.tgz"}
